This folder contains implentation(s) of the IC algorithms and/or its extensions (e.g. PC).

IC.R:
    step 1) modified version of pcalg::skeleton (file PC.R)
    steps 2)+3): implemented, working, but should be checked

PC.R: see above

IC_test.R: code testing the running time

prior_Campos.R: will contain functiones needed for the IC/PC algorithm to use the prior knowledge, "under construction"

randomBN.R: to create random BNs with normal distributed data and lin. dependencies

convert.R: should contain fucntions to convert the different pgraph representationsm, "under construction"
